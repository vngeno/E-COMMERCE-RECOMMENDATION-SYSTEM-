# E-COMMERCE-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM-

# Introduction

Today, more and more business entities and industries are on the way to e-commerce, and with the popularity of machine learning and artificial intelligence, a lot of companies have adopted these techniques to serve their marketing and even doubled their sales. According to Sucharita Mulpuru, a Forrester analyst, Amazon’s conversion to sales of on-site recommendations could be as high as 60% in some cases based on the performance of other e-commerce sites. And 35% of sales come from their recommender system.[1] This project will introduce and implement the recommender system by using Amazon consumer reviews data because their data volume is large enough and the dimensions are wide enough to be used in a recommender system.
The dataset wa sourced from Data World. It contains product reviews and metadata from Amazon, including 28332 reviews spanning 2019 - July 2020.[2] The dataset includes 23,331 reviews (ratings, text, reviews) and metadata (descriptions, category information and brands).

# Recommender System

Many e-commerce and retail companies are leveraging the power of data and boost sales by implementing recommender systems on their websites. Recommender systems, in short, are designed to predict users’ interests and recommend items a user might be interested in. Recommender system typically generates recommendation lists in the following two ways -- collaborative filtering and content-based filtering (also known as a personalized-based approach).
